        Hey! Here is some info you need to know: <br>
   1. This site is for educational and testing purposes only and<b> not </b> meant for school use. <br>
       2. Make sure to refresh tabs for the updated site data to load in, even if you open the website again, you <b> still </b> need to refresh. <br>
        3. <b>Do not share </b>this website with <b> anyone, </b> we do not want to flood discord chat with randoms. (Chat also gets cleared often.)<br>
        4. This site is still a <b> work in progress. </b>(I'm new to coding) <br>
        5. Please report bugs on the discord on <b> #issues. </b> <br>
         6. No impersonation on discord chat (<b>Don't believe everything people say, you can fake it easily.</b>)
